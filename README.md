# PROJECT X Æ A-12

This libary will contain functions to generate random strings, sentences, and paragraphs using Python. It is inspired by the recent rumours that Elon Musk and Grimes have named their newborn "X Æ A-12". I was talking to a friend and we joked that they must have used a random string generator to get that name. I then realized Python does come with a Random Integer module, but not a Random String module. I'm sure there are libraries out their, but I decided to make my own.
